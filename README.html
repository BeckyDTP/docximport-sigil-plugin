<h1>DOCXImport (A Sigil Plugin)</h1>
<p>Import DOCX documents into Sigil as epubs</p>
<p>A Sigil plugin based on the Python <a href="https://github.com/mwilliamson/python-mammoth">Mammoth module</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h1>Building</h1>
<p>First, clone the repo:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/dougmassay/docximport-sigil-plugin.git
</code></pre>
<p>To create the plugin zip file, run the buildplugin.py script (root of the repository tree) with Python (2 or 3)</p>
<pre><code>$python buildplugin.py
</code></pre>
<p>This will create the DOCXImport_vX.X.X.zip file that can then be installed into Sigil's plugin manager.</p>
<h1>Using DOCXImport</h1>
<p>If you're using Sigil v0.9.0 or later on OSX or Windows, all dependencies should already be met so long as you're using the bundled Python interpreter (default).</p>
<p>Linux users will have to make sure that the Tk graphical python module is present if it's not already.  On Debian-based flavors this can be done with "sudo apt-get install python-tk" for python 2.7 or "sudo apt-get install python3-tk" for Python 3.4.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> Do not rename any Sigil plugin zip files before attempting to install them</li>
</ul>
<p>This plugin will work with either Python 3.4+ or Python 2.7+ (defaults to 3.x if both are present).
The absolute minimum version of Sigil required is v0.8.3 (Python must be installed separately prior to v0.9.0)</p>
<p>Configurable preferences (available after first run in the plugin's corresponding json prefs file) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>epub_version</strong> : a string value that determines which epub version to create (defaults to: "2.0"). Choices are "2.0" or "3.0"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>check_for_updates</strong> : a true or false (boolean) value (defaults to true). Check online for newer versions of this plugin.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1>Contributing / Modifying</h1>
<p>From here on out, a proficiency with developing / creating Sigil plugins is assumed.
If you need a crash-course, an introduction to creating Sigil plugins is available at
http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=251452.</p>
<p>The core plugin files (this is where most contributors will spend their time) are:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mmth (modified Mammoth module)
&gt; cbbl (modified Cobble module)
&gt; parsim (modified Parsimonious module)
&gt; plugin.py
&gt; plugin.xml
&gt; quickepub.py
&gt; updatecheck.py
&gt; utilities.py
</code></pre>
<p>Files used for building/maintaining the plugin:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; buildplugin.py  -- this is used to build the plugin.
&gt; setup.cfg -- used for flake8 style checking. Use it to see if your code complies.
&gt; checkversion.xml -- used by automatic update checking (not yet implemented).
</code></pre>
<p>Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests (or just use it privately to experiment).</p>
